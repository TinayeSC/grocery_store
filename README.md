# Sam's Grocery Store 

This repository was used as my introduction to using github pages. The site that is published in this repository is one of my first html static website's which utilise bootsrap. The purpose of this site was to develop my skills for the aesthetic side of devloping websites. Since creating this page, I have begun learning how to add functionality to buttons, forms, dropdowns, etc. However, this site does not have any fucntionality beyond aesthetic.
